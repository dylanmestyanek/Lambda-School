# Lambda School Projects

This is a large repository containing *every* project I worked on during my time at Lambda School. Each repository is nested as a submodule. 

**Please Note:** Submodules will link you to the most recent commit - *not* the master branch. If you would like to see the most relevant, and up-to-date version, please ensure to checkout the *'dylan-mestyanek'* branch if you are viewing a project that is not under the "Build Week" or "Labs 19 Group Project" category. Only Build Week projects have the most recent code on the master branch. :)

**Structure:** Each week consists of a daily project, in addition to a weekly *"Sprint Challenge"* held every Friday morning. Every 4 week segment consists of *"Build Week"* or *"Project Week"*. These projects were built as a team with a group of other Lambda Students.
